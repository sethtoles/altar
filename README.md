An Experiment In JavaScript Game Dev

### What's the point?
I want to make a game. I have no idea how. I'm not particularly interested in learning a new toolset, but very interested in learning how a game comes together. I'll be using plain old JavaScript, no libraries, but some newer (ES2015) features for convenience. I will most likely end up using some algorithms that other, smarter people have came up with. Otherwise, everything here is me, stumbling through unfamiliar territory.

### Running
Download the project and open index.html in a browser with modern JS features enabled.

Maybe someday I'll add a compile step for older browsers.
