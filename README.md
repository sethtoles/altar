An Experiment In JavaScript Game Dev

### What's the point?
I want to make a game. I have no idea how. I'm not particularly interested in learning a new toolset, but very interested in learning how a game comes together. I'll be using TypeScript for better tooling, and Parcel for bundling, but no other libraries. I will most likely end up using some algorithms that other, smarter people have came up with. Otherwise, everything here is me, stumbling through unfamiliar territory.

### Running
```sh
npm i
npm run start
```
Then open a browser to http://localhost:1234.
